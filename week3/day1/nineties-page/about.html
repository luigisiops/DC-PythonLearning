        About Me!
    </div>
    I am a graduate from Rutgers University class of 2019 in biomedical engineering. From my undergrad
    I was able to take some cs courses but I never really got excited until last year when I began learning on my own.
    Since then everyday has been a new learning experience and I'm so excited to have joined digital crafts!
